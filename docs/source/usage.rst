Usage
=====

Installation of Ycleptic gives access to the ``Yclept`` class.

``ycleptic`` is meant to be used inside any Python package where the developer
wants to specify the allowed formats, expected values, default values, required
values, etc., of a YAML-format user input file (a "configuration").

To use ``ycleptic`` in your package, you should create a "base" configuration file for ``ycleptic`` that lives in your package as a package data.  More about that file in a moment.

You then might like to create a "config" class for your package that is a descendant
of ``Yclept``, and initialize it with your base config and a user config:

```Python

from ycleptic.yclept import Yclept
from mypackage import data

class MyConfig(Yclept):
   def __init__(self, userconfigfile=''):
      basefile=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(data.__file__),"base.yaml")
      super().__init__(data.basefile,userconfigfile=userconfigfile)
```

Wherever you want to generate the configuration:

```Python
   c = MyConfig("my_config.yaml")
```

Here, I've assumed you've got a module-data directory ``data/`` that has 
a file "base.yaml".  The file `my_config.yaml` is the user's config file.  The "base" config defines the directives that the user is allowed to "declare" or "specify" in their own config file.

The heart of ``ycleptic`` is the base configuration file, which the developer must write. Below is an example:

```
directives:
  - name: directive_1
    type: dict
    text: This is a description of Directive 1
    directives:
      - name: directive_1_1
        type: list
        text: This is a description of Directive 1.1
        default:
          - 1

          - 3
      - name: directive_1_2

        text: This is a description of Directive 1.2
        options: [ValA, ValB]
  - name: directive_2
    type: list
    text: Directive 2 is interpretable as an ordered list of directives

            text: Directive 3.2.2 has a list of possible subdirectives
            directives:

                text: D 3.2.2a executes a series of flips
                directives:
                  - name: nflips
                    type: int
                    text: Number of flips
                    default: 0
                  - name: flipaxis
                    type: str
                    text: Axis around which flip is performed
                    options: ['x','y','z']
              - name: d322b
                type: dict
                text: Subdirective D 3.2.2b saves the result
                directives:
                  - name: filename
                    type: str
                    text: name of file to save
                    default: flipfile.dat

```

The base config opens with the single identifier ``directives``, under which is a list of one or more top-level directives.  A directive is a dictionary with keys ``name``, ``type``, and ``text``, and then data content.

``type`` can be one of ``int``, ``float``, ``str``, ``bool``, ``list``, or ``dict``.  The data content in a directive is of type ``type`` unless two conditions are met:

1. ``type`` is either ``list`` or ``dict``; and
2. the keyword ``directives`` is present.

In this case, there are subdirectives.  If the ``type`` was ``dict``, then the subdirectives are children of the parent directive and all operate at the same level.  If the ``type`` was ``list``, then the subdirectives defined are expected to be ordered as a list of tasks that the parent directive executes in the order they appear in the user's config file.  In the base file, both are entered as lists of directives.

``text`` is just meant for helpful text describing the directive, and it can be completely free-form as long as it is on one line.

There are three other keys that a directive may have:

1. ``default``: as you might expect, this are default values to assign to the directive if the user "declares" the directive but does not provide it any values.
2. ``required``:  a boolean.  If False, that means no defaults are assigned; if a user declares this directive without providing values, an error occurs, but a user need not declare this directive at all.  If True, the directive must be declared (and if it is nested, all the antecedant directives must also be declared).
3. ``options``: a list of allowed values; if the user declares this directive with a value not in this list, an error occurs.

The ``Yclept`` class has a method called ``console_help`` that is meant to provide interactive help to a package user trying to develop their own config file that conform's
to your package's base config.  

Suppose this is the content of ``config.py``:
```Python

from ycleptic.yclept import Yclept
from mypackage import data

class MyConfig(Yclept):
   def __init__(self, userconfigfile=''):
      basefile=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(data.__file__),"base.yaml")
      super().__init__(data.basefile,userconfigfile=userconfigfile)
   
```

Here is an example of how the interactive help works:

```
>>> from mypackage import MyConfig
>>> c=MyConfig()
>>> c.console_help()
    Help available for directive_1, directive_2, directive_3
```

This reflects the fact that the three top-level directives available are called ``directive_1``, ``directive_2``, and ``directive_3``, respectively.  To drill down, you just add the directive names:

```
>>> c.console_help('directive_1')
directive_1:
    This is a description of Directive 1
    type: dict
    Help available for directive_1_1, directive_1_2
>>> c.console_help('directive_1','directive_1_2')
directive_1->
directive_1_2:
    This is a description of Directive 1.2
    type: str
```

In this way, you can interactively explore the whole structure of the base config, and learn how to write a user config.
